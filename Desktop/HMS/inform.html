                <p>A gynecologist is a doctor who specializes in female reproductive health. They diagnose and treat issues related to the female reproductive tract. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries and breasts.

                    Anyone with female organs may see a gynecologist.  80% of those who see one are between 15 to 45 years old. </p>
                    <p>What Does a Gynecologist Do?</p>
                       <p>Gynecologists give reproductive and sexual health services that include pelvic exams, Pap tests, cancer screenings, and testing and treatment for vaginal infections.

                        Some gynecologists also practice as obstetricians, who give care during pregnancy and birth. If a gynecologist has expertise in obstetrics, they’re called an OB-GYN.</p>

                    Dentists are trained professionals who help care for the teeth and mouth. Regularly seeing a dentist can help you to maintain a good level of dental health, which may have a direct impact on your overall well-being.
                </p>
<p> What Does a Dentist Do?</p>
A dentist has many responsibilities, and one of the most important is promoting good dental hygiene. This helps to prevent complications in your mouth or other parts of the body.

A dentist also diagnoses and treats problems of the gums, teeth, and mouth. Dentists use modern technology and equipment like X-ray machines, lasers, drills, brushes, scalpels, and other medical tools when performing dental procedures. They also wear protective equipment like gloves, masks, and safety glasses to prevent the spread of germs or bacteria.

<p> Some common dentistry tasks include:</p>

<p>Teaching people about dental hygiene</p>
<p>Filling cavities</p>
<p>Removing buildup or decay from teeth</p>
<p> Repairing or removing damaged teeth</p>
<p> Reviewing X-rays and diagnostics</p>
<p> Giving anesthesia</p>
<p> Putting in fillings or sealants</p>
<p> Checking the growth of teeth and jawbones.</p>
<p> Dentistry requires a team approach, and the dentist is the leader. Working with the dentist are dental assistants, hygienists, and lab technicians. Together, the team ensures that people get quality dental care.
